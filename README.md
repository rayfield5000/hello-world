# hello-world
Temp repo for testing out github.

Greetings!

rayfield5000, I am interested in coding and learning the possibilities. 
I started on codecademy and moved to FreeCodeCamp and loved it. Right now I'm learning 
html css and goal of learning JS. I love tacos and bacon. Goal of mine is to learn 
app development down the line I find apps are interesting but I am content with learning
web development. I'm enjoying the experience.
